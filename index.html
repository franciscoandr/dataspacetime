                <h1>Will There Be Condominiums in Data Space?</h1>
                <div class="specialText">Video artists, and particularly interactive video artists, have developed approaches that can help us think about new media more broadly. For example, in the 1960s, when video seemed to be only lesser film for many people (less both in cost and value), artists began to explore the distinctive features of
                the video medium.</div><div class="otherText"> They have continued their explorations as the technologies involved—cameras, editing systems, image synthesis equipment, screens and projectors—have evolved. Hans-Peter Schwarz notes, in his “MediaVisions” essay, that the early results began to call into question the
                sacrosanct status of montage, which had been central to film from the time of Eisenstein and Podovkin, in a manner even more fundamental than what experimental film had accomplished up to
                that time. Part of this was through exploration of immediacy—examples of which include Nam June Paik’s immediately-screened video of the Pope’s visit (◊15), Les Levine’s self-surveillance installations at Software (◊16), and video environments in which artists presented images of the audience itself using different sorts of displacements in time and space: with a few second’s delay, in a narrow corridor, while traversing a maze. Though television production had used the technologies of video for some    time, artists’ video reconfigured public and industrial conceptions of the video image—via means ranging from site-specific installations to the “music video” form.</div><div class="specialText">Bill Viola has been one of the highest-profile of video artists, allowing him to create, in recent years, what some have called “70 millimeter” video art—work in which video’s lower cost is not a primary attraction for the artist, and the traditionally rough production values of video art are not present.</div><div class="otherText">However, what has remained consistent from Viola’s grittier early work to his massive late-1990s retrospective at the Whitney Museum is a poetic approach to exploring the video medium. As Michael
                Rush wrote in his New Media in Late 20th Century Art, “Bill Viola’s work, perhaps more than any other, represents the tendency toward the lyrical in art” (140).This view of Viola’s work is perhaps instructive when considering the essay reprinted here—for
                example, during his discussion of the MIT Media Lab’s famous Aspen Movie-Map. The project was brilliant, but limited by the fact that it was structured around a video hardware hack (as discussed in Andrew Lippman’s paper from SIGGRAPH 1980) which was mapped onto a navigation system meant to be as familiar as possible, so as to bring something already imagined to life. It remained for artists to seek, instead, surprise, and to create defamiliarizing forms of interaction that would allow the technology to be envisioned anew, instead of as a step toward making real what we already expected.
                The work of Lynn Hershman (◊44) and Grahame Weinbren are important artist-led explorations of
                interactive techniques and structures that, as Viola discusses, go beyond the basic branching flowchart,
                a structure that had been applied to narrative two decades before by Raymond Queneau (◊12)
                Hershman and Weinbren’s work, as well as Viola’s own, relates to the Aspen project or commercial            interactive video as poetry relates to an instruction manual or brochure. An instruction manual that
                makes us consider language anew is usually a failure—such a document must be transparent in order
                to be effective. Of course, the creation of effective structures for such manuals is a formidable
                challenge, and such documents are essential. But few would wish to live in a culture in which our            ability to understand and use language was limited to what is evoked by such documents.</div>
                <div class="specialText">Possibly the most startling thing about our individual existence is that it is continuous. It is an unbroken thread—we have been living this same moment ever since we were
                conceived.</div><div class="otherText">It is memory, and to some extent sleep, that gives us the impression of a life of discrete parts, periods, or sections, of
                certain times or “highlights.” Hollywood movies and the media,
                of course, reinforce this perception.
                If things are perceived as discrete parts or elements, they can
                be rearranged. Gaps become most interesting as places of
                shadow, open to projection. Memory can be regarded as a filter
                (as are the five senses)—it is a device implanted for our
                survival. The curse of the mnemonist is the flood of images
                that are constantly replaying in his brain. He may be able to
                demonstrate extraordinary feats of recall, but the rest of the
                banal and the mundane is playing back in there too, endlessly.
                The result can be lack of sleep, psychosis, and even willful
                death, driving some to seek professional psychiatric help (and
                thus become history on the pages of medical journals and
                books).1 This reincarnates one of the curses of early video
                art—“record everything,” the saturation-bombing approach to
                life which made so many early video shows so boring and
                impossible to sit through.</div><div class="specialText">Life without editing, it seems, is just
                not that interesting.
                It is only very recently that the ability to forget has become
                a prized skill. In the age of “information overload,” we have
                reached a critical mass that has accelerated the perfection of
                recording technologies, an evolution that leads back to ancient
                times.</div><div class="otherText">Artificial memory systems have been around for centuries. The early Greeks had their walks through temple,2 and successive cultures have refined and developed so-called “mnemo-technics”—Thomas Aquinas described an elaborate
                memory scheme of projecting images and ideas on places (fig.
                31.2); in 1482 Jacobus Publicius wrote of using the spheres of
                the universe as a memory system (fig. 31.2); Giulio Camillo
                created a “Memory Theater” in Italy in the early 1500s; and
                Giordano Bruno diagrammed his system of artificial memory
                in his work Shadows, published in 1582. Frances Yates describes
                this entire remarkable area in her brilliant book The Art of
                Memory (University of Chicago Press, 1966).
                When I was in Japan in 1981, I visited a festival of the dead
                at one of the most sacred places in the country, Osoresan
                Mountain. There I saw blind female shamen called itako calling
                back the spirits of the dead for inquiring relatives, a centuriesold
                practice. Until that time I had felt that the large Japanese
                electronics companies were way ahead in the development of
                communications technology. After witnessing the itako,
                however, I realized they were way behind. Right in their own
                backyard were people who, without the aid of wires or
                hardware of any sort, have been for ages regularly
                communicating through time and space with ancestors long
                gone. An interesting place at the temple site (which was
                perched in the surreal landscape of an extinct volcanic crater)
                was a special walk for the visiting pilgrims to take along a
                prescribed trail. The way led from the temple through a
                volcanic wasteland of rockpiles and smoking fissures to the
                shores of a crater lake. It was called “the walk through Hell.”
                The path through the landscape and the points along it all
                had special significance. The itako, to call up the dead, took
                this “walk through Hell” in their minds, bringing the spirits
                in along the familiar path, and when they were through, sent
                them back the same way.</div>
                <div class="specialText">The interesting thing about idea spaces and memory systems
                is that they presuppose the existence of some sort of place,
                either real or graphic, which has its own structure and
                architecture. There is always a whole space, which already
                exists in its entirety, onto which ideas and images can be
                mapped, using only that portion of the space needed.</div>
                <div class="otherText">In addition to the familiar model of pre-recorded time
                unfolding along a linear path (as evidenced by many things
                from our writing system to the thread of magnetic tape
                playing in a videotape recorder), there is another parallel to
                be linked with modern technology. “Data space” is a term we
                hear in connection with computers. Information must be
                entered into a computer’s memory to create a set of
                parameters, defining some sort of ground, or field, where
                future calculations and binary events will occur. In threedimensional
                computer graphics, this field exists as an                    imaginary but real chunk of space, a conceptual geometry,
                theoretically infinite, within which various forms may be
                created, manipulated, extended, and destroyed. The graphics
                display screen becomes that mysterious third point of view
                looking in on this space (we often call it our “mind’s eye”),
                which can be moved about and relocated from any angle at
                will. The catch is that the space must exist in the computer
                first, so that there is a reference system within which to
                locate the various coordinates of points and lines called into
                being by the operator. In our brain, constantly flickering
                pulses of neuron firings create a steady-state field onto
                which disturbances and perturbations are registered as
                percepts and thought forms. This is the notion that
                something is already “on” before you approach it, like the
                universe, or like a video camera which always needs to be
                “video-ing” even if there is only a blank raster (“nothing”) to
                see. Turn it off, and it’s not video anymore.</div>

                <h1>Time Frames</h1>
                <div class="specialText">Scott McCloud is the Aristotle of comics, showing the way for contemporary thinkers who would seek to rigorously analyze emerging media. What Aristotle did for Attic drama in the Poetics, McCloud has done for the neglected form of comics.</div><div class="otherText">He has explained what the most talented comic artists knew, although only Will Eisner had
                begun to articulate it—how the comic format works, and what its underlying structures and
                techniques are.</div><div class="specialText"> He began by rigidly defining comics as “sequential art”</div><div class="otherText">(or, if further explication is
                necessary, “juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence”). McCloud then found
                that, based on this definition, comics are as old as the ancient Egyptians. From there, he went on to
                consider many of the important higher-level techniques of the comic artist: How does the variation
                between generic and specific representation of people work? What “happens” in between the panels
                of the comic images we read? What are the uses of color in the comic art form? And, as is discussed
                in the chapter excerpted here, how can time be represented in a medium which is (although it is
                read over a period of time) purely spatial? It is hardly necessary to even mention that McCloud’s
                work has implcations for combining text and image, but it provides other lessons and examples.
                Many of those involved with new media are pleased by McCloud’s deft metacomic tricks, a
                number of which are represented in this chapter.</div><div class="specialText">Since McCloud uses a narrative medium suited to
                general exposition, he was able to write a comic about comics, and  take advantage of this to
                illustrate (in every sense of the word) his points.</div><div class="otherText">Other similar attempts are not always as
                successful: although there have been buildings constructed mainly to comment on architecture,
                these are not usually popular or very habitable structures. While the first edition of George
                Landow’s Hypertext was issued by Johns Hopkins on disk as Hypertext in Hypertext, this edition
                never gained wide scholarly currency—not being as widely cited as the book it was based upon—
                and Landow’s Hypertext 2.0 was not issued in a similar format. Some interest in hypertextual
                criticism of hypertext remains, as can be seen in the September 2002 special issue of the Journal of
                Digital Information, edited by Jill Walker and Susana Tosca. Perhaps this will build upon other
                nonfiction hypertext work to provide interesting results; it may also simply be dancing about dance.</div><div class="specialText">
                Looking to Understanding Comics can provoke new media insight, but it’s certainly not the case
                that all of McCloud’s techniques can be easily dragged and dropped into the digital realm.</div><div class="otherText"> What
                McCloud’s work nevertheless shows is that new forms, even those that have not been studied
                seriously for centuries or even decades, do indeed have certain conventions and rules, and that if
                the form being studied is considered with care and thought, these rules can be determined,
                benefiting those who work in the form and are striving to improve the practice of their art.</div>
